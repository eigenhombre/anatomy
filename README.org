* A Tool for Studying Muscles

... turn notes on muscular anatomy (Emacs [[https://orgmode.org][.org]] format) into [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] flashcards.

** Why?

A figurative artist has to know his or her muscles, er, inside out.
This is especially helpful when constructing the figure from
imagination.  Various approaches have been taken to learning artistic
anatomy.  While I'd rather not rob graveyards and [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361109/][do dissections]],
there are, fortunately, excellent anatomy books[1] available for the
artist.

I have found the muscles harder to learn than the skeleton, so
developed the method outlined here.  Other methods include drawing
muscles and bones on tracing paper over figure drawings or
photographs, or sculpting muscles atop a pre-formed skeleton.  This
practice supplements, but does not replace, those other methods.

A few key facts can be helpful to learn, for each of the important
muscles (< 100 of them, roughly):
- Muscle name
- Origin of muscle (attachment point to the fixed part, generally on
  the skeleton)
- Insertion of muscle (attachment point to the more mobile part)
- Function: what the muscle does
- What the muscle overlaps
- What the muscle is overlapped by.

These last two points can be helpful in constructing a mental
model of the muscular forms and of the entire form they help to
create.

I use [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] as a tool for memorization.  Anki uses a carefully
designed model to set the timing of when you see individual cards,
showing you ones you got wrong sooner, and gradually showing them less
and less often as you learn.

For all the muscles you want to study, you can enter these key facts
into a table, and then export the table into flashcards (I find this
method preferable to typing it into Anki directly).  Merely entering
the data in the first place starts the memorization, and then each
table field can be paired with the muscle name both "forwards" and
"backwards" (fact->muscle and muscle->fact) as separate flashcards.
Thus, for, say, 100 muscle names and the associated five facts per
muscle, one has 100 x 5 x 2 = 1,000 flashcards.

The tiny [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]] program in this repo facilitates exporting the Org
data into Anki, which accepts tab-separated lines.  I run it whenever
I add new muscles into my table.  (If I enter a few muscles a week, it
should roughly keep up with my memorization practice, and I have the
most important ones down solid in well under a year with minimal
effort.)

** Sample program output

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ lein run
Function of Sartorius	flexes, weakly abducts, rotates upper leg; flexes and medially rotates lower leg
Muscle w/ function flexes, weakly abducts, rotates upper leg; flexes and medially rotates lower leg	Sartorius
Origin of Sartorius	Just below tip of ASIS
Muscle with origin 'Just below tip of ASIS'	Sartorius
Insertion of Sartorius	Pes anserinus, on tibia
Muscle with insertion 'Pes anserinus, on tibia'	Sartorius
Sartorius overlaps...	Gracilis, Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis, Adductor Longus
Gracilis, Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis, Adductor Longus are overlapped by...	Sartorius
Function of Deltoid	flex arm forward, abducts outward, pulls backward
Muscle w/ function flex arm forward, abducts outward, pulls backward	Deltoid
Origin of Deltoid	lateral 1/3 of clavicle, acromion process, spine of scapula

** Workflow

After cloning this repository and changing to its directory,

1. Edit =resources/muscle-structure.org=
2. Export Org file to CSV (=org-table-export=) in the same directory
3. Run the program and save the output: =lein run > cards.txt=
4. Import =cards.txt= (removing any previously-imported entries first) into Anki
5. Memorize away!
6. Repeat as new muscles are added.
